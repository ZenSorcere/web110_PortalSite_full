            <h2 class="subheader">Accessibility</h2>
            
            <h3>HISTORY OR WEB ACCESSIBILITY</h3>

                <p>These days, Web Accessibility isn't a New Thing &trade;. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) launched in 1997, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (requiring any websites developed for federal government use to be accessible to disabled users) was signed into law in 1998, and the first Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0) were published as an official W3C recommendation in 1999 (Hoffmann)<sup>1</sup>.</p>
                <p>Despite that history, there are still many sites that don't take Accessibility into account, and encounter discrimination litigation for violating Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is being interpreted to include websites as “places of public accommodation” (Rivenburgh)<sup>2</sup>. According to David of the Bureau of Internet Accessibility, <em>"In 2018, there were 2,258 web accessibility lawsuits filed in the U.S., nearly tripling from the 814 lawsuits in 2017."</em> (David)<sup>3</sup></p>

            <h3>WHAT IS IT</h3>

                <p>As developers, we've heard "Web Accessibility" used for many years now, and most are familiar with it as requirements to make web sites usable for web users with disabilities. Most people think of disabilities in terms of permanent physical handicaps like blindness, deafness, or those who are physically unable to use a mouse or keyboard. However, there are broader definitions, including varying degrees of the previously mentioned challenges, as well as users that may be experiencing temporary or short term disability, not permanent. We all start experiencing sight and/or hearing loss as we get older, or someone may be suffering from a broken hand, or eye damage, for example. Web Accessibility helps these users, as well.</p>
            
            <h3>BENEFITS OF WEB ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
            
                <P>Making your web pages available and functional for disabled users allows your site to be accessible to more people.  Approximately 1 billion people, 15% of people in the world, and approximately 1 in 5 Americans, live with a disability (Kramer)<sup>4</sup>. That many people have significant buying power, and companies that don't accommodate those potential site visitors are ignoring significant revenue opportunities.</P>

            <blockquote><strong><em>In the UK, where the large disability market is known as the Purple Pound, people with disabilities and their families spend at least £249 billion every year. In the US, the annual discretionary spending of people with disabilities is over $200 billion. The global estimate of the disability market is nearly $7 trillion."</em><br>- Rush, w3.org<sup>5</sup></strong></blockquote>

                <p>In addition, Web Accessibility isn't just for disabled users; abled users benefit widely from WCAG standards, as well. Many technological aspects that are taken advantage of by everyone today started out in development to accommodate disabled users. Things like auto-complete, voice controls, personal digital assistants, and even non-web related advancements - automatic doors and faucets, email, self-driving cars - all have accessibility features that enhance the user experience for everyone, not just disabled persons (Rush)<sup>5</sup>.</p>
                <p>Businesses, too, can reap huge benefits. Improvements to PR, as customers like companies that have positive stances on social issues and show their support accordingly. Companies benefiting from improved SEO through smoother interfaces and clean navigation will drive more users to their site. Other benefits include broader market reach, significantly reduced maintenance cost, improved customer satisfaction, and lawsuit avoidance.</p>
                <p>With the advent of HTML 5.0, there are many features that assist in making websites more accessible to disabled users and how they access the web than ever before. Developing your pages from the beginning with Web Accessibility in mind allows for the most user access, and the most potential benefit for you or your company.</p>
